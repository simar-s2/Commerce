# 🛍️ Commerce – Django Auction Web Application

**Commerce** is an online auction platform built with **Python (Django)** and a **Bootstrap-based HTML/CSS** front end. It allows users to create and manage auction listings, place bids, and engage in discussions via comments. The project showcases developer Simarjot Singh’s full-stack skills: the backend uses Django and the front end uses Bootstrap for responsive design. Key features include user authentication, listing creation, bidding, commenting, category filtering, and watchlists.

## Features

- **User Accounts:** Secure registration and login (leveraging Django’s built-in auth system)  
- **Auction Listings:** Create, edit, and view auction items (title, description, starting bid, image, category)  
- **Bidding:** Place bids on active listings; the system tracks the current highest bid  
- **Comments:** Leave comments on any listing to discuss items with other users  
- **Watchlist:** Add or remove listings from a personal watchlist for quick access to favorites  
- **Category Filtering:** Browse and filter listings by category (e.g., Fashion, Electronics)  
- **Admin Panel:** Manage all site data (listings, bids, comments) through Django’s admin interface
